This is Apache::Sybase::ConPool, a connection pooling module for
mod_perl and Sybase database servers.

Copyright (c) 2001 by Michael Peppler.


This module uses the fact that Sybase client connections can be shared
between processes to create a pool of database connections that can
be shared between all of the httpd processes using mod_perl. The 
connections are created during the Apache initialization by
including this module in a startup.pl or pre-load.pl script
loaded with a PerlRequire directive in httpd.conf.

I have been using a version of this module for about a year now on a 
site with a farm of 40 web servers, and it has worked well. The
caveat is that connections can't be re-initialized while the 
web server is running, so you have to stop/start Apache to
reconnect to the database if the database is rebooted, or if the
connections become unusable for any other reason.

The eg/ directory has a sample conpool.cfg file, as well as
a simple pool.cgi script that illustrates usage.

Credit where credit is due department: I initially got this 
technique from Kenny MacLeod, who suggested it when I was
inquiring about connection pooling in the Sybase newsgroups
about a year ago.

Comments are as usual welcome!
